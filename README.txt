About Innr
Founded in 2012, Innr founders Jeroen and Rob (both ex-managers at Philips) put all their
energy into creating beautiful, practical and smart lighting with the motto „Simple and
Affordable". By closely following the lighting and smart home trends, Innr can respond early
to customer needs and create the perfect Smart Lighting products. This knowledge is
reflected in both the quality of their products and their personal service.
Innr makes high-quality LED lighting systems for the living, working and outdoor areas. Innr's
LED technology replaces classic incandescent and halogen bulbs with „smart" dimmable
LED bulbs that can be controlled via smartphone, tablet, remote control or voice control.
Connect the energy-efficient lights to your Homey, create atmospheric scenes per room and
let the light support your activity or mood.
